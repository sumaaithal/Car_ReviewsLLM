## 📊 Project Tasks

### 1️⃣ Sentiment Classification

**Goal:**  
Classify the sentiment (positive/negative) of five car reviews from the dataset `car_reviews.csv`.

**Steps:**
- Use a pre-trained sentiment analysis model.
- Generate predicted labels → `predicted_labels`
- Convert predictions to binary list `{0,1}` → `predictions`
- Evaluate performance:
  - Accuracy → `accuracy_result`
  - F1 Score → `f1_result`

**Outputs:**
```python
predicted_labels   # Model sentiment predictions
predictions        # Binary mapped labels
accuracy_result    # Accuracy metric
f1_result          # F1 metric
